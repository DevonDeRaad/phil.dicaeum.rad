Summary Trees

Summary trees generated by SumTrees.

Summarization Information
-------------------------
Trees read from 1 source(s):
- 'bootstraps.100.trees'
Total of 100 trees analyzed for summarization:
- All trees were treated as unweighted
- All trees were unrooted
- 4 unique taxa across all trees
- 7 unique splits out of a total of 600 splits
- 2 unique non-trivial splits counted out of a total of non-trivial 100 splits
Summarized onto consensus tree with minimum clade frequency threshold of 0.05:
- Support values expressed as proportions or probabilities
- Edge lengths on target trees set to mean of edge lengths in sources
- Support and other summarization annotations added to target trees as metadata
