# ADMIXTURE code

* This folder contains all of the input and output files from running ADMIXTURE. 'thinned.nooutgroup.mac.vcf' is the input file used for this run, with outgroup samples and singleton SNPs (MAC = 1) removed. 'run.mac.admixture.sh' is the script used to execute this run on the KUHPCC. The entire process can be viewed in a vignette style at this link: [https://devonderaad.github.io/phil.dicaeum.rad/admixture.mac/run.admixture.html](https://devonderaad.github.io/phil.dicaeum.rad/admixture.mac/run.admixture.html).
