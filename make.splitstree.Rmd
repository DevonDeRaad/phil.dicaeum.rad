### read in your filtered vcf file
```{r}
library(vcfR)
library(adegenet)
library(StAMPP)
#read vcf
v<-read.vcfR("~/Desktop/phil.dicaeum/filtered.85.vcf")
```

### prepare input matrix
```{r}
#convert vcfR to genlight
gen<-vcfR2genlight(v)
#check sample names (remember the splitstree gui won't let you visualize more than 10 characters in a sample name, and all sample names must be unique)
gen@ind.names
#edit your sample names to fit this criteria
gen@ind.names<-gsub("D_hypoleucum","hy", gen@ind.names)
gen@ind.names<-gsub("D_nigrilore","ny", gen@ind.names)
#double check sample names
gen@ind.names

#assign sample names as populations (population assignments are a requirement for the stampp functions, but can be arbitrary here because we want a pairwise divergence matrix among all samples, not samples assigned populations)
pop(gen)<-gen@ind.names
#make pairwise divergence matrix among all samples
sample.div <- stamppNeisD(gen, pop = FALSE)

#export for splitstree
#stamppPhylip(distance.mat=sample.div, file="~/Desktop/phil.dicaeum/dicaeum.85.filtered.splits.txt")

#open this file using the splitstree GUI. Take a screenshot and use the knitr function 'include_graphics' to show the resulting tree in this document alongside the code used to generate it:
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/devder/Desktop/phil.dicaeum/phil.dicaeum.initial.splitstree.png")
```

### fiddle with the results
```{r}
#I don't like how the outgroup looks (weirdly nested within one of the clades on a super long branch)
#Let's remove the outgroup and then revisualize the splitstree
#remove two nigrilore samples from the vcf
v.sub<-v[,colnames(v@gt) != "D_nigrilore_KU28413" & colnames(v@gt) != "D_nigrilore_KU28414"]
```

### redo with no outgroup
```{r}
#convert vcfR to genlight
gen<-vcfR2genlight(v.sub)
#fix sample names
gen@ind.names<-gsub("D_hypoleucum","hy", gen@ind.names)
#assign sample names as populations
pop(gen)<-gen@ind.names
#make pairwise divergence matrix among all samples
sample.div <- stamppNeisD(gen, pop = FALSE)
#export for splitstree
#stamppPhylip(distance.mat=sample.div, file="~/Desktop/phil.dicaeum/dicaeum.85.nooutgroup.filtered.splits.txt")

#open this file using the splitstree GUI. Take a screenshot and use the knitr function 'include_graphics' to show the resulting tree in this document alongside the code used to generate it:
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/devder/Desktop/phil.dicaeum/splitstree.nooutgroup.png")
```

### Make this presentable for publication
```{r}
#at this point, I will edit the tree in the splitstree GUI to remove sample names and add dots on the end of each branch, which can be color-coded according to sample locality, giving me a nice, publication quality product
#my final result:
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/devder/Desktop/phil.dicaeum/splitstree.png")
```
