# Mitochondrial analyses

### Raw data
* The alignment used for all reconstructions is called 'Hosner.nd2.sample.assignments.nex', and the sampling details for all included individuals can be found in the file 'hosner.nd2.sampling.xlsx'.

### Strict clock BEAST2
* The input file prepared using *beauti* for performing a reconstruction with a strict clock and HKY substitution model is called 'strict.HKY.xml'. The optimal tree, the log file used to check convergence, etc. for this run all begin with the prefix 'strict.HKY'.

### Relaxed clock BEAST2
* The input file prepared using *beauti* for performing a reconstruction with a relaxed clock (exponential prior) and HKY substitution model is called 'relaxed.HKY.xml'. The optimal tree, the log file used to check convergence, etc. for this run all begin with the prefix 'relaxed.HKY'.

### IQ-TREE 2
* The details for maximum-likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction using IQ-TREE 2 can be found in the folder called 'iqtree'.
